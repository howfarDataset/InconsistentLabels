In some datasets, there is no instance with the same name because the path of the two adjacent versions changes. But path changes are uniform and subtle, so they can be handled automatically or manually.

Commons-collections: After 3.3, the paths to 4.0, 4.1 have changed, and need to change /Collections4/ to /Collections/

Commons-configuration: After 1.10, paths to 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 have changed, and need to change /Configuration2/ to /Configuration/

Commons-digester: After 2.1, paths have changed to 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2, and need to change /digester3/ to /digester/

Commons-jcs: Paths have changed since 1.3 for 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2. Path change is large, do not make uniform modification.

Commons-jexl: after 2.1, paths for 3.0 and 3.1 have changed, and need to change /jexl3/ to /jexl2/

Commons-lang: After 2.6, paths from 3.0 to 3.7 have changed, and need to change /lang3/ to /lang/

Commons-math: After 2.2, paths from 3.0 to 3.6 have changed, and need to change /Math3/ to /Math/

Wss4j: 2.0.0, 2.1.0, 2.2.0 paths have changed since 1.6.0. The path changes are very large, almost completely different, and do not make uniform modification.


Three project versions not available in the IND-JLMIV+R(2020) dataset in our paper:

Santuario: There is no version of santuario-Java-1.5.9 on the official website and Github.

Parquet-mr: 1.8.0 and 1.9.0 are special. Code on the website and Github can be accessed but can crash the Understand software.
